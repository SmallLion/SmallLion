A Game developer highly passinated about Hyper-causal games. Experienced with the technologies listed in the **toolbox** below.

I create tech content, mostly about Python, **but** I also talk about other topics than coding. I'd advise you to subscribe to stay up-to-date!

I managed to create an online presence with my [Blog](https://mr-unity-buddy.hashnode.dev/), which is accessed by more than 3000 people monthly. Looking forward to reaching and helping more people by sharing my knowledge 🌐
